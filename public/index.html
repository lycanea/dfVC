	<h1>basic little empty explanation page</h1>
    <p>this is lyca's df vc!</p>
    <p>this uses peer websocket data to transmit voice data and manages connections and position data through a central websocket server</p>
    <p>its not perfect but it works decently and id like to keep working more on it</p>
    <p>the room id correlates to the plot id, there *should* be no way to fake position data or join a room without the plot allowing you to first</p>
    <p>more plot specific features such as muting and deafening players, teams systems, broadcasting players voices to other players</p>
    <p>this is scalable and appears to work well (apart from some odd like... 5 second initial vc connect delay) and is designed to work with multiple plots at a time :3</p>
    <p>its not exactly ready to be used for other plots fully and reliably yet, but if your interested let me know and please suggest some features youd want for use in your game</p>
    <p>also, plot developers that want specific stuff for their game, id be glad to give specific plots some custom css or layout for their game if you so please :3</p>
